## Introduction
This project is about foot print dataset generation and identification. Footprint dataset developed at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur, as part of post doctorate research project. A database for off-line footprint images for personal verification is developed. Data set is collected from persons of different age, gender, profession and educational qualification. The footprint images are stored as images in JPG image format for efficient use. The dataset consists of 1360 images of their original size with manually annotated name, age, gender fields. Data are also collected from person from different geographical locations of India.

- Created models and the **largest footprint image dataset** of $1360$ images from $1688$ persons ($99$ males and $69$ females), $3-5$ samples/foot, where age is varying from $18-40$ years at three different resolutions: $500, 600$ and $1200$ dpi using ``Canon imageCLASS MF3010'' scanner cum printer. The dataset developed is open for research.
- Designed for **low to medium-security identification**, not high-security access control systems.
- Achieved $TAR = 87\\%$ @ $FAR = 10.0\\$ to $TAR = 60\\%$ @ $FAR = 1.0\\%$, showing promise of using footprints biometrics for authentication.

- **Applicable** to wellness, healthcare, and public safety, including spa/aquatic access and payments, **newborn identification, diabetic foot** monitoring, and biometric health analysis.

- Supports **monitoring and forensic:** public-space, places of worship, crowd monitoring, gym-based foot biometrics, and inmate skin profiling.

This repository contains the code for shape descriptors and Eigen Feature extraction from foot dataset.

## Highlights:
- Footprint annotated largest dataset at different resolutions and angles for person recognition of 168 people from geographically diverse places.
- Two phase data collection of 1360 images at three different resolutions from more than 160 people.
- Dataset from diverse category of people having different profession from Indian ethnicity involving service class, labor class, and college students.
