This project is about foot print dataset generation and identification. Footprint dataset developed at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Malaviya National Institute of Technology as part of post doctorate research project. A database for off-line footprint images for personal verification is developed. Data set is collected from persons of different age, gender, profession and educational qualification. The footprint images are stored as images in JPG image format for efficient use. The dataset consists of more than 1300 images of their original size with manually annotated name, age, gender fields. Data are also collected from person from different geographical locations of India.

This repository contains the code for shape descriptors and Eigen Feature extraction from foot dataset.

Highlights:

    <ul>
    <li>Footprint annotated largest dataset at different resolutions and angles for person recognition of 168 people from geographically diverse places.</li>
    <li>Two phase data collection of 1360 images at three different resolutions from more than 160 people.</li>
    <li>Dataset from diverse category of people having different profession from Indian ethnicity involving service class, labor class, and college students.</li>
    </ul>
